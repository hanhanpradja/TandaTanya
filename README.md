A Register Login System using Python, Served in GUI too with Tkinter

I built a single app using Tkinter that can direct us to some webpages (w3schools) for learning basic programming
language such as Python, C++, C, Java etc

User need to Register and Login to this app.
The best feature is Register and Login system and the modern UI using basic Tkinter function (easy to understand)

1. User Cannot register with Username that already used before
2. System can detect the wrong username or password
3. Simple UI design make it comfortable to access
4. All declared functions purpose was scripted with comment, see the source codes
Enjoy!

Note: 
- I use Tkinter because is not time consuming
- If you want to look detail about how login and register system work, look at login.py and register.py
